### 👋 Hi, I’m Udit Khanna

💻  I am an experienced backend software engineer, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Hearsay Systems.

👀  I’m interested in everything related to Native Cloud Development, Infrastructure As Code, and improving CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

🌱  I’m currently learning more about enterprise architecture in the context of microservices. 

💞️  I’m passionate about mentoring junior software engineers so feel free to reach out to me for a coffee chat.

💻  I love solving complex problems with (almost)simple solutions!

📫  Visit me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/out01">LinkedIn</a>! or shoot me an <a href="mailto:ukdevelops@gmail.com">Email</a>  

❤️ When not in front of a screen, I like to Run, Snowboard, Yoga, Meditate, Dance, Hike, Paint, and laugh a lot.
