👋 Hi, I’m Udit Khanna.

💻 I am an experienced backend software engineer, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Hearsay Systems.
👀 I’m interested in everything related to Native Cloud Development, Infrastructure As Code, Open-source tools, and improving software deployments through CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about enterprise architecture in the context of microservices.
💞️ I’m passionate about mentoring junior software engineers so feel free to reach out to me for a coffee chat.
💻 I love solving complex problems with (almost)simple solutions!
